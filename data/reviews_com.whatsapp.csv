Transferring to a new phone has never been such a pain in the ass. Restoring Whatsapp's drive backup kept returning with 'failed to restore messages from drive'. Try to reinstall, restart the process multiple times then the SMS verification cooldown time keeps compounding—and you'll get hit with a 48 hour wait time until the next OTP. At this rate I'll lose all my chats.  It's like the migration fails, the backup database is corrupted, and then the system is built to lock you out from ever getting it to work. Asking for a support request returns with a half-assed templated response, instead of a real person intent on helping. Is this typical of tech services that get this huge? Instead of getting actual solutions, all you get in response on a 'support' ticket is ""follow instructions"". Guess we can never expect any response to these app reviews either.  Understandable I guess—since they have a billion users, they'll never have the time or care to address the individual who needs help. I've easily been using Whatsapp for over 8 years, this issue really takes the cake.  Does anyone know about the recent security breach too? Welp, time to switch to Telegram.",1,60
