It's a shame they couldn't make that profitable. Why couldn't they just have put ads between friends' stories and called it good? Discovery used to be decent, but now it's just toxic, clickbaity garbage. Not to mention that Instagram copied stories and did it 10x better, with interactive content and links to other apps. I only use this app because I don't have any other alternatives, and that's a very, very bad thing.",1,685

I have the Huawei P20 Pro which has some of the best cameras currently on the market for smartphone devices, but when I try to use the cameras in the dark to either record or take a picture the video freezes, is pixelated and framerates are really bad. Im sure its an easy fix for the app developers. It doesn't give the app the credit it deserves",2,1

It's great. But with the rise of devices using triple camera setups perhaps it's time think about how all three cameras can be fully utilised. For example on the P30 Pro I don't think the higher resolution 40 MP camera lens is used,4,3

Including the ability to customize an avatar using the Bitmoji app so you feel like you're having a more fun and engaging conversation with a person.

Freeze up and delete messages that I didnt even get a chance to see. Etc.  If you live in an area with less than A+ Cell Reception or Wifi. Prepare for an uphill battle trying to get anything to send, or if it does, getting it to send in order, or at all. Sometimes video wont just fail to send. It will critical error and just not send.  Snapchat is one of the very few texting applications I have that will send messages in any random order if the initial send fails for some reason. So if you want a nice video to send in order. Take a slightly longer one with your regular camera and then send it.   Its ok for what I want to use it for.",2,4

Yeah could y'all test your updates before releasing them. Group chats are scuffed and you can't see people's messages half the time. Starting a new group doesn't solve the issue either. For the love of people's sanity release a test client before rolling out updates.,1,0

2018 flagship smartphone with a top of the line camera and snapchat turns it into garbage. this app is slow and camera quality is garbage,1,3
It's quite slow whenever I go on it but the filters r rlly good it's better than I thought it would be - only 4 stars tho,4,2
this needs a serious update I'm video chatting someone and there is no audio on my end or there's so plzz send a update out and ik it's not mine or there phone and it's not our internet so update it and make sure to fix it,2,0
let's talk about how these new updates got rid of creating stories from memories. Like what?,1,1
"ever since the new update where the layout changed its been so glitchy. my snaps dont post in order, some of them dont post at all. some of them stay a black screen so you cant view it. its all just a big mess ive had to uninstall and reinstall about 10 times",1,6
"i wish i knew how to look at trophies on the update unless there is no trophies, but the games you can play in chat are so much fun.",4,0
"i really like the filters except i cant make a bitmoji because its "" not compatable with my device"" so they should fix that so that im not excluded.",4,0
i want the new update and no matter how many times I've tried i still havent gotten it it's a little frustrating,3,1

I think is had really good graphics and controls and I love all the filters and because of my friends I can talk to them since they might not have a phone number,5,0
This snapchat sucks. It turns pictures upside down. It will talk your good pictures and make them look horible. This thing justs sucks.,1,5
i upgraded my phone from an iPhone se to a galaxy s10e but the story's would save and the picture was better.,3,0
the update is a good beginning but recording videos using Snapchat is still bad on Android. a little bit better but still bad,2,1

"Why change the font options, just to change them back to the old ones again? I liked the newer ones way better...",2,0
"when I send someone a message it will say ""opened 7 minutes ago"" even though they haven't opened the message??",1,0
you need to have subtitles on your stories. I can't enjoy anything on your app because I am deaf and can't understand whats happening in the stories you insist on filling up my feed. even stuff thats not amusing.,1,9
I only keep snap to save memories of whole stories. The app only let's me save one at a time. Snapchat just doesn't learn ever with its updates.,1,0

"This app is using my camera in the background at various times, when I'm not using the app. This is creepy and needs to be fixed. Edit: You used my camera for 10 minutes again today. Creepy!",1,1
After the new update it wont let me log into my eyes only. And it deleted ALL of my saved photos!!! I HAD SOME IMPORTANT PHOTOS ON THERE!,1,0
I dont like it anymore...It kicks me off when i try to text my friends...UGH!! I wish the old style was back and im also thinking its only for Iphones now...I hope Team Snapchat can fix this issue and go back to the old style. Thank you for reading💜,2,1
the app was good until this update happened and it just looks less iconic/original. snap before used to have sliding transitions for like everything which made it so pleasing and easy to use but now its really unoriginal and unattractive,1,0
"It's really fun playing around with the filters but why is the video quality so low and blurry? Sometimes it works well but lately my snapchats have been super blurry, fix this please",4,0
new bug with the latest update it doesn't show the latest message sent but instead shows the previous one that's been opened also shows that they have been opened when they haven't been,4,0
"Until recently, Snapchat let me add text in landscape mode automatically. Now I have to add text in portrait mode, after changing to a font other than the default, and then rotate the text manually. What a pain!",2,0
everything is great except I van no longer see when someone takes a screen shot. it used to notify me but now it doesn't. i love snapchat but that was important feature that i would like back. Or could someone enlighten me if im missing something.,2,0
The new update is really irritating. It doesn't even show streaks of a particular person. I cannot move my photos from camera roll to my eyes only neither I can save my photos from somebody's chat........ It need to be fixed up soon.,2,0
This is my favorite app. I love using snapchat so much. It makes my photos look much better than it use to look I lo e this app so much I am grateful that the app has been made Thanks for making snapchat so good and its the best app even I wouldn't ask for a better picture app,5,7

I love snapchat with a passion but ever since the update it keeps saying coming soon on things like on the other update if someone sent me somebody elses snap i coulf click on it and add them on this update it pops up at the bottom saying coming soon and never pops up,4,0
The newest update as of 3/24/19 does not allow for a bitmoji of the person I'm snapping to be added to my snap I'm sending. This is inconvenient compared to the previous version,4,0

"The new update is bad and i cant even open snaps and my friends cant open mine either. Also always shows ""seen"" even if not seen.",1,0
I've been using snapchat for years and with the latest update i think theyve taken away snapchat because everytime i hold my finger on the camera screen it doesn't come up with the circle anymore showing its looking for music and snapcodes,4,0
I just updated the app and I've lost all my contacts and previously saved snaps. Plus it won't show me my contacts to add again. Pathetic,1,0

messages from weeks ago wont send and prevents from seeing if someone has opened a snap or messages. My Snapchat worked fine before the second to last update and now crashes often for no reason. I have no way of deleting unsent messages that could hopefully help fix my Snapchat.,3,1
i am facing a different version of snap chat than others and i am surprised that no servers were taking care of our feed back and support care.,1,0
Half of the videos I try to send after the last update dont ever send and are lost forever. only way to get rid of the did not send notification is to sign out and sign back in of snapchat. How did this happen?,1,8
"It's nice and I love the updates. I can talk to my friends, take pictures, and more! I also love all the cute and or silly filters",5,2
"lately have been re-installing as some messages refuse to send and are stuck on ""waiting to send"". some stickers i try to make wont work either",3,0

"Though the effects are good, but still it hangs my phone up and takes long time to recover.. average quality..",3,0
"Like the concept, but it's very slow and laggy for Android. You can't ""share the moment"", because it's over before the app starts - defeats the purpose of the app.",1,1
