0,"FINALLY events displayed on a map!! but why only 20 at a time? Why can't I see every event in a designated area? This makes me think i'm still missing stuff. Can you please add this map feature to the desktop website? Now if only you could make ALL real estate/rental listings show up on a map in my groups and marketplace (all my groups plus public posts aggregated into marketplace), PLEASE PLEASE make rental listings easier to search this way!",4,131
1,"I wanted to uninstall Facebook but still get event info, but this app is really poorly designed for finding things you want to do. It's all controlled algorithmically rather than just being able to find the same events as I would on the FB app without all the addictive brainhacking FB is doing. I can't believe that this isn't on purpose.",2,69
2,"This could've been a great alternative to Facebook event system without the social clutter however, a lot of events never show up and somehow gets filtered compared to Facebook. Even following a venue that on Facebook has the events listed some of those events never show up in Local obviously making this app subpar if you can't rely on all the events actually being displayed and thefore constantly have to double check between apps.",2,88
3,Just downloaded this app. The map feature doesn't work. Just a grey graph screen. At first I didn't think it would bother me but I was wrong. It's driving me nuts. Such a basic feature to the app... disappointed.,3,9
4,APPsolutely recommended 4 experiences + to get out there + grow your life. U can search anywhere for whats on + also just explore any area. Calendar + events on maps is great. Also lists what events your friends are going to. Recommends other events for you too. just having notifications about the events you are interested in is brilliant. no more nosy scrolling thru everybody's personal news. you can also sort your preferences on f.b to only see what you want to see with the see first feature.,4,16
5,"Can't even sign in. I enter my correct password, then enter my 2 step verification code, then it tells me my password was incorrect. So I changed my password, still no dice. Brilliant.",1,3
6,"I can finally uninstall the main Facebook app! As someone who hates checking Facebook amongst all of its clutter, but also loves to find and explore events through it, this is a great tool. I love how I can still get notifications, except the only notifications I get are related to events, and are a really useful. The UI is lovely to look at as well!",5,1669
7,"Wow what a let down! This app has so much potential! What happened? Verrry laggy; takes ten times as long to scroll. Searching?! Nope, nothing popped up for my searches, however going back to FB I can find what I was searching for. I really wanted to like this. Hopefully there is a revamp soon.",2,1183
8,"Keeps you informed about all the goings ons in your area (or selected area) based on your interests. Not just geared towards young party animals! Cater to a vast array of people. Theres plenty for All ages, locations and interests!",5,30
9,Great to use to find events locally and to friends who are interested. It can pin point and save your places on the map. Just what I need!,5,10
10,love knowing what is going on,4,
11,Doesn't Work - Blank Screen,4,1
12,Best of all must downloden,5,
13,brilliant extremely useful,5,
14,waste of time,1,
15,very wroast app,2,
16,"Wow. What a let down. Here's an idea, Facebook. If you're going to migrate the event filtering features over to the main app make sure it's not broken. I search for things happening in my area and it suggest events many county's over. What do you expect, that I got the Facebook money to take 3 taxis over 6 hours?",2,438
17,"Lots of glitches (ie: ""more details"" doesn't expand the data, following a notification doesn't take you to the right place, I could go on). This app would be very useful if functioning properly. I find myself going to the main Facebook app to do things this can't. Edit 4/15/19 still lots of glitches. Local shows blank screen when clicking on notification. Unable to see notification again as it is not listed in the regular Facebook app notification log.",2,42
18,Was looking for events for my birthday in my city. It showed events on that would happen and end days before. When it did show an event it was almost 18 miles away. Map failed to load several times. Not worth the download if you plan to enjoy activities nearby. Two stars because of the volume of events even though they are no where accurate by location or time.,2,71
19,"Thought I would love, since I'm kind of new in town. Perfect way to see what's going on. Wouldn't take my correct email/PW combo, so buh-bye. Not giving up time out of my day to straighten this out. Uninstalling app now.",1,117
20,"It's nice to be able to see events outside of Facebook, but it has a few things that don't work well. Typing is glitchy. It doesn't automatically capitalize, space after punctuation, or other defaults. You have to hit space 3 times after each word to get it to work. It would also be nice to have control over what notifications you receive. Currently there's no settings in the app, so you can only block or allow all on your phone. I don't need a daily guide, but I would like to see new invites.",3,43
21,"There needs to be options to customize this app. I would like to be able to set my preferences. I don't want to have to scroll through events for kids. I'm wasting alot of time looking for what interests me, which defeats the purpose of this app. Please fix.",3,308
22,"We had reserved seats, but had to wait in line outside for over 2 hrs. Was no bathroom facilities outside and they would not let you in the building till 3 PM. Needs to be more organized as far as parking and getting in",4,2
23,"Finally, the last reason I kept Facebook app is gone and I can uninstall the app. Thanks you for this! The app is buggy and slow to respond. It takes unbelievable 95 MBs of space but hey, it's the first release :)",3,276
24,The app itself is great but the execution is very hit or miss. The app consistently freezes or doesn't load. One specific bug is when I try to view my local guide list that I made and i have to force close the app. It does get tedious and annoying when I just want to view the guide I made but can't even access 😕,3,82
25,"i love the idea of this app, but the execution was pretty bad. the app is slow and buggy, and irs frustrating to use. when i get notifications for an event i was invited to, it just slowly opens a blank screen and I have to kill the app. again, love the idea, but i still have to do most everything in the Facebook app because Local just isn't there yet",2,109
26,Out dated local knowledge with no apparent way of updating of making suggestions or reporting closures. Many of the places in my town listed have closed and many new places that have been open sometime have not be added. Quite a ridiculous app.,1,174
27,"The app loaded up, got me to give it various permissions and then went to an apparent ""home screen"" (denoted by a house icon) but then wouldn't do anything at all! DOESN'T WORK ON HUAWEI MATE 20 PRO so uninstalling and unimpressed!",1,54
28,Took 5 minutes to install and open. Looked around the app for 5 minutes. Slow. Inchoreant. I really wanted to like this because I like the idea but it just doesn't serve it's purpose well. So I uninstalled. Maybe in a few months I'll reinstall and see if things have improved.,1,125
29,"Get out of your rut! This is a great app to find things to do! The app takes events from Facebook and combines them all in one app, easy to use and interact with. I love the calendar feature! Find paint nights, bars, bands, workshops, classes, restaurants and anything that has been created as a public event on Facebook. We've filled several weekends with activities in the mornings and evenings. Great way to break the mold and find something fun to do.",5,186
30,"Great app when it works. Freezes too often. You have to exit the app and open it again to get it to work. I love it when it works, so not giving up on Facebook Local just yet. Hoping they fix it and I can change this review soon.",2,16
31,DEVELOPERS: was LOVING this app for the last year BUT now suddenly it logs me out every time. i have to log in every time i use it. i also uninstalled my Facebook app which I'm guessing is related soooo make it so that i can keep it logged in without the Facebook app or else this app is USELESS in the go and it's use has plummeted.,2,46
32,"Fails to deliver. App opens then collapsed. Did manage to scroll through events once but tried several times since with no joy! Great idea, but please fix issues.",2,28
33,would be a 5 but the notifications for events notify you AFTER they're over. never on time. and no settings to customize notifications that I'm aware of. not in a way that would help. it's very frustrating. i was just notified of an event today that was at 4 or 5pm and it's 10:27pm right now... not very helpful at all. and too many events to remember them all by memorization.,2,52
34,This app has a lot of potential but its really slow. the about page on events doesn't even pull up. The downloads will go through the roof if you can make it load everything faster.,3,8
35,"the very first thing that popped up on the very first day that I downloaded this app, was political, a meeting for people better in a different political party and me. I'm really not political but I so don't agree with this political party. So I'll just support local my way, positive proactive energetic and with a great deal of enthusiasm and Effectiveness to help other nonprofits",1,27
36,"Great app. All the best Facebook functions in one app. Just one small problem: In individual events, on the top fixed posts won't show up anymore at all in the app while they are still there on the website. Really annoying and probably easily ""fix""able.",4,5
37,"Man. I loved this app but the recent update has rendered it unusable. Suddenly none of my events appear and I get pushed these useless ""lifestyle lists."" Bring back basic event search!",2,34
38,the filters on this app are frustrating to use and are always pre-set and i feel that i only see events that i may be interested in. when id prefer to see everything. i know there are events upcoming but this app doesnt always show those events unless i really dig. i feel like im missing a lot. i wouldnt recommend using this app but instead try to go to a desktop instead,1,3
39,Very failure app. If you can mix Facebook events with calendar features. Then it can be good. But right now. It's worst. I also can't change my calendar view in here,1,33
40,App is quite useful. but it crashes and get stuck time to time. So it's hard to use. I'm gonna give it chance until the next update to fix it. if not I'm gonna uninstall.,3,3
41,"Absolutely worthless. Never finds anything. Facebook, or even a simple Google search does a much better job. I had searched for a gastro event for this weekend (I even knew its name!) . It came up with a presentation about psychopaths to be held months (!) later.",1,47
42,"No category for conventions or Comic-Con!! Not easy to find any comic book convention, anywhere. Only get 1 or 2 results. Conventions are huge events and fall under multiple categories like arts, literature, shopping etc. Needs it's own category!!!",2,84
43,"I love the app and the concept is great, but performance continues to disappoint. Doesn't feel optimized. Slow startup and loading times, sometimes doesn't load anything at all and app needs to be restarted. – Google Pixel 2XL, Android 9",2,21
44,"Great app and feature set. But performance wise it is frustrating, and I'm using a Pixel 2XL. Tapping a notification leads to and endless loading page. sometimes hlthe home page doesnt load. if fixed. this would be superb and a four/five star review.",3,15
45,"This app has effectively broken Facebook events for me. Every time someone posts in an event and I click the notification, it opens local but not the event itself so i have to dig around and find what the notification was trying to tell me. Very bad integration with Facebook too.",1,28
46,"Just another way for Facebook to drain my battery using location services for a pointless app. All the functionality of this app is already in the Facebook app, I don't understand why they made this at all.",1,109
47,"I do have an quite up to date timeline but the app doesn't load events, hoping a way around it would be copying the link to the event and open it in the browser. But that also doesn't work. :(",1,12
48,"My events, popular events, suggested events,.... Just show me all the events in one list with some filters. That's all. Gone back to Facebook events page. Stupid app",1,65
49,"Full of bugs, slow, i dont nnow if this was confusing my fb notifications or not but my guess is that it did. Otherwise it is a good idea to have an app like that, unfortunately it needs to be matured. Will try again in 6 months.",1,17
50,"A whole app but it still is worthless. Let people search by day, distance away, and show on map. Not too complicated.",1,78
51,"Broken. This app is just broken and useless. I was using it to monitor notifications for an event I'm hosting, and 1) it won't list out the people who decline, 2) it groups together notifications of people who have declined (Jane, John, and two others have declined) so I have no idea who declined, and 3) won't load the event page, so I can't see if someone has commented or posted in it. It is useless and broken.",1,160
52,"I don't understand and don't know why this app got negative reviews. In fact, it's amazingly beautiful app. I now know what all events and things happening around me so easily. Wow. 😊",5,12
53,"I use this app and it is useful. However, it is very buggy. It's difficult to find events you've RSVPed to. Adding comments is completely broken with my keyboard (every word i type is converted to the word 'I'm'. Seriously.).",3,16
54,"I love the concept, the only thing I really use the facebook app for anymore is to keep tabs on events so this was the perfect excuse to finally get rid of Facebook on my phone. I can't stress how badly I wanted this app to work but I've only been able to use it once since installing, it has consistently crashed within 5 seconds of opening the app. I really hope they fix these serious technical issues so I can give the 5 star rating I so desperately want to give.",2,61
55,It provides good information if you can actually find something. It iss so slow and sluggish. Difficult to use. It hangs. It's laggy.,2,3
56,"Wish I could give zero stars, because it just. does. nothing. I've tried everything and it just shows an empty page, time and time again.",1,9
57,"Don't have an opinion... Looks useful and promising but I couldn't connect to test it... 90+ mb's (....???) to stuck in the ""login with Facebook"" screen... Is it certain that this is a Zuckerberg application?",1,17
58,It is not up to date. Some business listed no longer exist and many good ones not included.,2,33
59,"Allright, but why not just include this in the standard facebook app? Use what knowledge one has from this app to make the events-secton of the main app stronger and more user friendly, instead of living with this fragmentation.",3,112
60,"It sounded so good, but I installed it. I live in the Blue mountains, most events were in the city, 80km away, not local would be a better name. Pity",2,10
61,Totally useless. Notifications you click on end with a blank screen. The main Facebook app does a much better job with the same notification.,1,21
62,doesn't let me login.... always says wrong password.... i afraid this might be a fake app to steal data,1,
63,"Not finding a way to use this app without having Facebook. Without that feature, the app doesn't work for me.",1,2
64,Great for those that want to stop mindlessly scrolling their newsfeed but don't want to miss out on hearing about events. Slick looking app with one big issue: it plays sounds even when my phone is on silent.,3,6
65,"this app never loads correctly, takes a long time to load, and often freezes. Its honestly easier to just use the facebook app to find the same info",1,7
66,So much easier to find events using this than full Facebook. Also great you have listened to people that want to use part of your platform but not all :),5,19
67,Love that lyrics show up automatically so don't miss beginning of song having to start up app. Really enjoy LyricsCards you can create and post to social media platforms. Great app!,5,85
68,Lack of advanced settings made me want to uninstall. Can't even figure out how to disable daily guide notifications which are annoying.,1,72
69,Completely unusable in current build. The app outright crashes after trying to load content with a frozen UI and a spinning loading icon.,1,4
70,"Interesting idea though i would have preferred this to be integrated in the Facebook app. Also while the app is useful for finding events, i find the layout a bit confusing",3,59
71,"It doesn't load, when the app is open. I get push notifications for events the day after they happen. I want to like it, but it's a wasted app. 😞",1,57
72,"Excessive resource utilization. Forced stop, literally never open it and it's used ~800mb and constantly rates for top resource usage within resources monitor so it's uninstalled.",1,6
73,"Good idea but poorly executed. Very laggy, doesn't actually show local things to do when you search for local events. Uninstalling.",1,8
74,"Utter rubbish. I searched my local area expecting to match my local knowledge against the wit and wisdom of this app's ""smart android"" intelligence. The so called local facilities and services recommended under each section related in most cases to a small handful of the worst of what is available! In some cases recommendations were miles and miles away whilst In other cases the businesses don't exist any more! One recommended Eatery which the app promotes and which WAS literally 60 metres from MY front door folded over 10 years ago! The app also constantly and annoyingly defaults to an area of central London despite location filters being repeatedly reset to ""near me"" which in my case is 280+ miles from that area!",1,9
75,"This app just doesn't work. Apparently I have 8 notifications on it, but all I get is a blank non-responsive screen. The idea is sound but the app is broken.",1,9
76,"App literally only fills up half the screen with no option to expand it. So, I can't even read the entire page of the events.",1,10
77,Local notifications never open the app correctly. almost everyone i tap on just takes me to a blank Local App screen,2,2
78,"The most unstable app I can remember using. A useful concept but not very well developed, realised or updated.",2,11
79,"I don't mind using another app, I do mind if its very broken, I actually like the idea of it though. Rarely loads for me, and is slow.",1,15
80,The app stopped in the middle of the events page and would go no further. I'm very disappointed and will be uninstalling this app.,1,54
81,"A laggy, poorly optimized system that takes address to load. It's a great idea, but the implementation is terrible.",2,11
82,aanother useless app from facebook. soon you will need a sepparate app for anything. thank you for not caring on users oppinion once again.,1,20
83,hate that i have to keep looking for my location. should be able to lock a location easily and not have to search it again.,2,
84,I used to LOVE this app! Now NOTHING shows up and I can't review my outings or future engagements! Disgusted! Bring back the original!!,1,9
85,"Worked for a while, but before I could use it for real it stopped working (crashed), and even on update app ""stopped working""",2,17
86,"Doesnt work, click to log into Facebook and the button flickers like its pressed but nothing happens.",1,12
87,"I like the app, just kinda annoying that you have to download it why can't this just be included in the main FB app instead of wasting more system resources?",4,77
88,"I really like this app, but it won't open 50% of the time. I have to kill the app and open it to make it work again.",3,6
89,opened app. it displayed nothing. nice try anyway.,1,2
90,This does not work on my phone anymore. I reinstalled it and it's a blank screen and I'm not able to search anything.,1,38
91,Share links generated by this app are not detected by this app on a receivers phone. Add functionality to be able to open Facebook event links with this app...it's the entire point of using this app 🤦‍♂️,2,37
92,Frequently freezes when opened from a notification. Duplicates most of the event functionality found in the Facebook app.,2,3
93,Doesn't function. At start shows an empty screen and simply freezes. I can't switch between the tabs. Used to work just fine so what changed?,1,6
94,"I wish we could created filters based on keywords or personalize what is recommended to us. For example ""I don't wanna see events with the keywords samba"". Other than that, it's a good option for those who want to get rid of the Facebook app.",3,15
95,Why the app doesn't let me open the full pages and events in the fb app or the browser ?!! What if I want to see the full page of a certain café for example or checking the page of a company that hosting an event,3,19
96,locks up constantly. you have to relaunch it two or three times to get any information to actually populate on the screen,2,2
97,FACEBOOK LOCAL IS GIVING BACK TO OKLAHOMA GROUPS AND OUR COMMUNITY. INCREASED MEDIA COVERAGE MAKING AWARENESS MORE ACCESSIBLE TO THOUSANDS. loop,5,11
98,"Absolutely useless. Filters don't work. I want to look for family events, in kent, today, and am being shown stuff that's on next month. Ridiculous.",1,2
99,Useless app. Brings nothing new to old Facebook app.,2,12
100,After the update it crashes before I can even get to the app! Super frustrating,1,41
101,"Great idea executed poorly. Slow, buggy, non-intuitive.",2,55
102,"So nice to get what I actually want and need from FB, without all the junky newsfeeds and notifications. A groups app would be nice to have next 🙏",5,5
103,"Won't load!! I've uninstalled reinstalled turned off phone turned back on, nothing.",1,21
104,"Constantly freezing, never gives notifications for events or comments made on event posts. Waste of time",1,3
105,"No show all events, no show events of others city's and neighborhoods. Map search do not work very well.",2,7
106,Used to be ok. Now I have to open it then close it then open it again as it always freezes the first time,2,7
107,"App doesn't work. I press ""sign in with Facebook"" and nothing's happening",1,21
108,Freezes EVERY TIME I tap something. Used to work nicely. Not any more. Oneplus 5 user.,1,1
109,"you need to fix the font, the letters are showing as squares, and can't pass the first screen, as i have a customized font which works everywhere but not your app.",1,6
110,The app freezes in a lot of the sections. It crashes when trying to create a new list of places,2,4
111,idea is great but poor execution. crashed and freezes constantly,1,5
112,Kept freezing. Not very intuitive. Didn't make it easy to do the things I wanted.,1,5
113,Please fix the bug that several people have mentioned where it opens to a blank screen and needs to be killed and reopened before it can be used! This happens most of the times I try to use it.,1,2
114,Shows places that are closed down years ago. Maps not good either.,1,22
115,"I like the concept, but the app does not stay in memory and takes a long time to open. I'm on LG V30.",2,26
116,Doesn't load anything. Acts as if there's no internet connection.,1,35
117,"Use work but hasnt worked in a while, tried deleting nd downloading it again but still same problem ,white screen and now of the on screen buttons working, was going to share screen shot of the problem but not possible in a review",1,1
118,Rarely ever even works. Would like tk use regularly but seems like FB doesn't spend the time to keep it running well on Android. Works fine on my wifes iphone. Also navigating to find events needs to be completely revamped.,1,4
119,Can't get past login screen. Useless. (Galaxy Note 3 / Android 5.0).,1,6
120,a good app to have a four different scribers in different Facebook and different websites just to have for software it update your software and update your drive hard drives and and cleaned it all out where the point where the system will be operating in a better order for you set up a better system you create your own self and show to the community you could build it yourself where build you a better website 4 people other uses,5,2
121,This app is great keeping me up to date with things to do and go looking forward to being busy haveing fun thank you,5,18
122,Can't even sign in. The button doesn't do anything. Useless.,1,30
123,"Crashed with blank white screen upon load. Note 9 Snapdragon, OneUI Jan patch.",1,1
124,"Why ask me to rate, the app hasn't even opened up yet. Maybe after I open it and use it. I can honestly rate IT",1,11
125,"live outside St. Louis-things going on here/to S, only things listed were for city itself!!",2,2
126,It's never worked for me. I'll get a notification on my phone and when I go to the app it's nothing but a white screen. Nothing loads up. I wait and wait and still nothing.,1,9
127,"The calendar is not used friendly. Especially if I""m browsing for future events of uncertain type of event.Good Freaking Luck with that. I want further than a week or two.",2,4
128,It used to work ok then it updated and wont allow you to search anymore. So disappointed.,1,4
129,Just what I've been looking for. Keeps me informed of all the events in and around Cape Town. Thanks you so much.,5,15
130,I just wanted Facebook and messenger to show up on my phone I can't get either one,1,3

136,"great app but ,i just want to go to a drive inn food,movie,hell it can be a swamp",5,38

140,"Very helpful, keeps you inform of every event happening in your state & community",5,34
141,"So slow, maps and data don't load. Completely useless, I'm amazed they released the app with so little testing as it just doesn't work.",1,1
142,I think it's a great page to have when you want to find a great place to go and when it's going to be.,5,19
143,"App sucks. It would be great if it worked, but it opens and doesn't show a single thing. I can't click any buttons either. (Pixel 2)",2,1
