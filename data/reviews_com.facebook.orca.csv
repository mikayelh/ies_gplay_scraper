Although you can still manoeuver or can press the buttons, you cannot see what you are doing cause the screen is black. In iOS 170.0 issue is not happening since the video automatically closes and there is no back button, only close button is available. Hoping for a good feedback about this. Thanks!",3,51

But there are a few things that I keep having problems with.  First off I keep having problems with the active status not showing things correctly. The active status either keeps staying active over night when she is not using her phone. Which has been making it so that when I go to messege her I end up waking her up because I can't tell if she is sleeping or not.  The second problem I keep having with it is that her active status and last active times keeps vanishing completely even though she has the app open in the background and its only been minutes since the last time we messeged each other.  With the exceptions of these two things, the app has been great and I am really happy its around.",4,227
